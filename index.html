    <h1>🧠 AI Network Health Monitor (In Progress)</h1>
    <p>(This AI-powered network health dashboard helps small businesses spot issues before their devices go offline. Unlike complex tools made for IT experts, it offers a simple, color-coded interface that shows real-time device status and ping updates. The goal is to alert users early — so they can act before a crash happens. Planned AI features include smart alerts, suggestions like “Restart your router,” pattern detection, and predictive monitoring using rule-based logic and AI tools like OpenAI)</p>
